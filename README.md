This script processes a text classification dataset, trains a transformer-based model, and generates predictions. It employs a structured approach utilizing Pandas for data handling, Hugging Face's `transformers` library for model implementation, and incorporates best practices for data loading, preprocessing, and model training. The code leverages a tokenizer to convert text into numerical representations, and train a transformer model using PyTorch and Hugging Face's Trainer API. The model is trained on the provided data with a batch size of 64.
